# Burglar-Detector
This is my simple project for detecting burglar by using PIRsensor and Reedswitch with NodeMCU, ArduinoNano, Blynk, Buzzer, and LED.
It can detects burglar by 2 ways. <br><br>**First by PIRs** => PIRsensor is sensor that detect motion. If burglar was passing through pirsensor, it'll make buzzer working then LED is lighten. At the same time, Blynk and Line will notify you that burglar was broken to your house. = alarm <br><br>
**Second by Reedswitch** => Reed switch is an electrical switch operated by an applied magnetic field. It detect burglar when he/she was open the door or window or etc. Then, alarming like first one.
